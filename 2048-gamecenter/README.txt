Comp 20 Assignment 4: 2048 Gamecenter

I have collaborated on this assignment with:
Patrick Coughran
Dan Defossez
Josh Hartigan

I have spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.

In the file html_actuator.js, the grid is stored in a variable called grid and
the score is stored in metadata.score

In this html_actuator.js file, I used jQuery inside the if statement that meant
that the game was to be terminated. This jQuery served to send a HTTP POST
to my gamecenter. Since I was using jQuery, I also included a script tag in
index.html that includes the jQuery library from online.
