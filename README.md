COMP 20 Spring 2014 Private Repo for Sean Deneen

This repository exists to hold all projects related to the Web Programming Course at Tufts University.

My favorite project/lab was OMFGDOGS but I am most proud of the 2048 gamecenter.

I am now confident in my ability to create basic webpages and tentatively write server-side javascript.
